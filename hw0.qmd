### Figure 1: $ax^2+bx+c$ vs $x$, where a = `r a`, b= `r b`, and c = `r c`

The figure above displays a simple quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c$ with $a$, $b$, and $c$ defined
as `r a`, `r b`, and `r c` respectively. A line at $y=0$ is also visualized for clarity. Point(s) are plotted at the X intercepts if applicable.

Given $a$, $b$, and $c$, we now solve for $x$ in the equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$.
There is/are `r len` solution(s) to this equation. If solutions exist, they are displayed below.

### Solution(s) for x: `r root`
